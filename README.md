# Instructions:
1. Open the CasoEstudio01_JimenaFloresCarmona folder in Visual Studio Code
2. In the public folder open the main.html file
3. With the file open, right click and select Open with Live Server (for now it will be displayed that way, during the process it will be modified and new instructions will be added; in the same way the Readme will contain the instructions)
4. After clicking on Open with Live Server, a tab will open in your browser (Microsoft Edge or Google) that will show a header with the FidÃ©litas University logo, and the body that contains a Notes Application title, and a Welcome to Notes Application message along with a description that will guide you to the start of the app. In addition to a footer that shows the date of Case Study 1.
5. Click on Start Notepad, that will open what would be the index.html file, which contains what would be the Notes Application, by selecting the Add a New Note button located under My Notes, you could start creating a new note (unfortunately, the operation of the app did not achieve its objective and there were several attempts on the server.js and script.js files, I tried by doing research and watching tutorials ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜žðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜¢). This note contains the option to write in the text area and save it, as well as buttons to edit or delete details of the note in the upper right corner of the same note (in the zip there is a folder called Example Tutorial Notes App in JavaScript).
6. If you want to return to the main menu of the app, in the lower right corner there is a Home button, right where the footer is, click to return to main.html
